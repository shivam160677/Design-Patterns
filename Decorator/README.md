#Decorator Pattern

This pattern lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

We have an interface which will be implemented by main Product and its decorator(wrapper) class.

In this example, PlainPizza class directly inherits from IPizza interface and PizzaDecorator also inherits from it with one exra parameter IPizza.
